- Scaling system to have the same render on every window size / machine
- Creating a Resource manager, that loads at the start of the game, so it doesn't have to load it every time
- Changing sf::Rectangle to sf::Sprite, using textures from the resource manager
- Tween librarie to add animations
- Small GUI, menu...
- Settings system (pretty easy, will do at teh end)
- HUD with other things than text
